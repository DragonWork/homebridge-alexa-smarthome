# Homebridge Alexa Smart Home

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebridge-alexa-smarthome)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-alexa-smarthome) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/homebridge-alexa-smarthome)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-alexa-smarthome) [![Build, lint, and test](https://github.com/joeyhage/homebridge-alexa-smarthome/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/joeyhage/homebridge-alexa-smarthome/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is the home of the official homebridge-alexa-smarthome plugin. This plugin enables smart home device integration between HomeKit and Alexa.

**Notice**

This plugin is in beta and has not been battle tested. Expect to encounter issues while using this plugin. Features and configuration options are subject to change. Please report all issues during the beta phase of this plugin so it can be improved for everyone. Pull requests welcome!

## Benefits

- Devices already linked to your Alexa account can be integrated with HomeKit automatically.
- Device groups created in the Alexa app can be integrated with HomeKit (possible but not yet supported). For example, a group of lights configured in Alexa could be automatically configured in HomeKit.
- Only Amazon credentials needed to configure this plugin rather than credentials for all your devices.
- This plugin does not store your Amazon username or password. Instead, it uses session cookies that are valid for up to 14 days.
